Solutions include:\n- Transparent data governance policies\n- Citizen consent mechanisms\n- Anonymization technologies\n- Democratic oversight of surveillance systems\n\n### Digital Divide\nEnsuring all residents benefit from smart city technologies requires:\n- Public Wi-Fi access\n- Digital literacy programs\n- Affordable device programs\n- Multilingual interfaces\n\n## The Road Ahead\n\nAs cities continue to grow – with 68% of the global population expected to live in urban areas by 2050 – smart planning becomes increasingly critical.\n\n> \"The cities of tomorrow must be both intelligent and inclusive, leveraging technology to improve quality of life for all residents.\" - Dr. Maria Santos, Urban Planning Institute",
